      <div class="job">
        <h3>Software Engineer - Teoresi SpA</h3>
        <p><em>Naples, Italy | January 2024 – Present</em></p>
        <p>
          I am currently working as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Teoresi SpA</strong>, where I have had the chance to
          contribute to exciting and innovative projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my main responsibilities has been developing the <strong>back-end for a resource management tool</strong>. This system provides real-time 
          visualization of weekly workload distribution across multiple projects, allowing users to monitor commitment hours efficiently. By optimizing SQL queries 
          and back-end logic, I ensured HTTP response times remained under 2 seconds, even with large datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have been part of a project focusing on the <strong>evaluation of autonomous driving algorithms</strong> for Stellantis. 
          My work has involved supporting workflows that ensure regression-free improvements, even with changes in sensors and test sessions. 
          This experience has deepened my understanding of scalable solutions and technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

      <h2>Academic and Personal Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>VIS-to-NIR Iris Image Transcoding Model</h3>
        <p><em>Python, TensorFlow | April 2023 – February 2024</em></p>
        <p>
          As part of my master's thesis, I developed a <strong>deep learning model</strong> to translate iris images from VIS to NIR 
          using pix2pix and U-Net architectures. This project enhanced segmentation and feature extraction, 
          increasing recognition accuracy by 71%. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that combined research with practical implementation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Breast Cancer Detection Using ULDP</h3>
        <p><em>MATLAB | September 2022 – January 2023</em></p>
        <p>
          I implemented the <strong>UDPR descriptor</strong> from scratch to analyze breast tissue in mammograms. This was integrated into a CAD 
          system capable of classifying masses and healthy tissues effectively. The project provided valuable insight into medical imaging and computer vision.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Autonomous Driving Agent with Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p><em>C#, Unity | May 2022 – September 2022</em></p>
        <p>
          I developed an <strong>autonomous agent</strong> leveraging reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO and SAC) to navigate a race track. 
          By integrating raycasting sensors, the agent could avoid collisions and detect checkpoints autonomously.

      <h2>Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Through these experiences, I have cultivated a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Each project, whether professional or personal, has 
        taught me valuable lessons, from writing efficient code to overcoming complex challenges. I firmly believe that technology can make a difference, 
        and I enjoy pushing myself to create solutions with real-world impact.
